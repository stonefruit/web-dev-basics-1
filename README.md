# web-dev-basics-1

## Objective

This tutorial is meant for basic learners, with the aim of providing easily accessible tools and content so that further experimentation and exploration can proceed.

Basic html/css/js is used in this module initially, and React is used subsequently as it will improve productivity and feedback to the student (at the cost of a lot of magic though).
